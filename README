HP TouchPad (tenderloin) Debian Kernel Builder
----------------------------------------------

This repository contains the files required to build a Debian compatible kernel for the HP TouchPad.  It builds the kernel and modules as well as the ath6kl driver from backports.  It outputs two final images, one for a native Debian install on a dedicated LVM volume (called debian-root) and another that will boot from a Debian root filesystem installed to the CyanogenMod /data partition (cm-data) in the /data/debian directory.  I call this setup "DebiAndroid" as it provides a Debian installation that can be used both in a chroot and natively outside of Android without having to repartition anything.  DebiAndroid installations require a datamedia Android installation (one where internal storage and /data are the same partition).  The kernel source and backports source are included as submodules, so you must git submodule init and git submodule update before running mkbootimg.sh.
